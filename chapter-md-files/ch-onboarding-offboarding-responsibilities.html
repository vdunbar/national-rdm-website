id="onboarding-offboarding-and-assigning-responsibilities">Onboarding,
Offboarding, and Assigning Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Well-designed onboarding and offboarding protocols are fundamental to
the success of a research lab or community of practice. This is
particularly true in situations where there is frequent turnover of
research members and participants, whether this be undergraduate
assistants, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, or faculty.</p>
<p>The intent of this section is not to define how one should engage in
onboarding and offboarding generally, but to highlight key issues
related to Research Data Management, that when properly handled as part
of bringing people on or seeing them off, help to ensure the many tenets
of RDM articulated in this text, including such things as
reproducibility, integrity, control and ownership, etc.</p>
<p>This section can be read in two ways: first, from the perspective of
someone entering a lab as a guide to the kinds of questions one should
be asking if they are not explicitly addressed by whomever is welcoming
you into the space; and second, from the perspective of someone
coordinating a lab as a guide to the kinds of protocols that should be
put into place to encourage and enable proper RDM processes.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-responsibilities">Assigning Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The purpose of assigning responsibilities to members of the lab
related to RDM is threefold: 1) to distribute work across a potentially
diverse team with different levels of responsibility to the lab or
project, 2) to assign accountability, and 3) to provide an answer to the
question ‘who should I ask about… ?’</p>
<p>Having a set of well-defined roles and responsibilities related to
RDM at the lab or team level and a standard set of roles and
responsibilities associated with each new research project will ensure
that work is streamlined and adheres to institutional or funder
requirements and RDM best practices. As such, roles and responsibilities
may need to be designated at the team or lab level as well as at the
individual project level.</p>
<p>Things to consider when assigning responsibilities to specific roles
or people include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience and growth potential of lab members</li>
<li>The need to ensure that information is both up-to-date and
timely</li>
<li>Implications, if relevant, to ethics or agreements with research
partners or funders</li>
<li>Adhering to institutional, funder, and publisher policies and any
other jurisdictional requirements that impact how research data are
managed, such as laws governing data sovereignty</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Communicating responsibilities</em></strong></p>
<p>Communicate responsibilities associated with specific roles or people
in the most appropriate place. This communication may be a general
onboarding or reference document for high level responsibilities or for
aspects related to responsibilities that are universal and not project
dependent. It may be in a readme file in a specific folder associated
with a specific project, because this is where someone would encounter
the need for this information.</p>
<p>Ensuring responsibilities are properly implemented can include some
system of checks and balances or periodic monitoring. Despite one’s best
efforts, errors and mistakes are a normal part of the research process.
Having processes in place to monitor roles and responsibilities can help
catch and address these errors. This is of particular importance for
projects where there is a high level of risk associated with mis-handled
data, such as a privacy breach.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is little harm in a reasonable amount of redundancy</li>
<li>Not everything is understood the first time around</li>
<li>Documentation articulating responsibilities should be up to date
with a system to indicate how current documentation is</li>
<li>Issues are more easily addressed if communication is early and
often</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h3>
<p>The purpose of standardized onboarding procedures is to make tacit
(implied, not stated) practices more explicit to ensure people can work
together more easily on shared projects and tasks. These procedures
should set up new team members, lab members, or research partners to
succeed from the start, directing them to the most appropriate
resources. In the context of RDM, this includes knowing who to talk to
and where to find resources and establishing the baseline conventions
(file naming, file storage, etc.) they should be using.</p>
<p>Getting new members off on the right RDM foot will help save time
(issues locating files, interpreting outdated documentation, etc.),
limit risk (accidental exposure of sensitive data, recovery of lost
files with backups, etc.), and ensure data are being properly purposed
(ownership and control, licencing, etc.)</p>
<p>When developing onboarding procedures and documentation, or when
being onboarded into a research lab or community of practice, the
following are things that should be addressed and that are covered in
this text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage locations</li>
<li>File backup procedures</li>
<li>File access and permissions</li>
<li>File organization and directory structures</li>
<li>Required documentation</li>
<li>Conventions for file naming and version control</li>
<li>Preferred file formats</li>
<li>Preferred licenses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offboarding">Offboarding</h3>
<p>Once a lab member or research partner has moved elsewhere, it can be
challenging to solicit information from them related to a project they
were previously involved in with you. And the longer your research
project operates, the more likely you will have people leave the
research team. As it relates to RDM, having a standard process for
offboarding people will help prevent or reduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>People taking passwords and/or files with them</li>
<li>Time lost locating files required for continued work</li>
<li>Possible file security breaches in the future</li>
</ul>
