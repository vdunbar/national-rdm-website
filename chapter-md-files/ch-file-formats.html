<p>A file format refers to the underlying structure of a digital file
and corresponds to the application(s) that you can expect to be able to
open and work with the data stored in the file.  It is important to
consider which file formats you should use to store your data. Also, if
your data sources are stored in a digital format (such as an image,
audio recording, video, etc.), equal consideration should be given to
the file formats these are saved in. </p>
<p>Sometimes the file formats you use will be dictated by things like
your choice of software or data collection instruments (audio, video,
statistical analysis, etc. applications often have built in file formats
they use, while a data collection tool, whether a survey tool or a
weather sensor, will also generally have a limited set of file formats
that they save incoming data to). Irrespective, throughout the research
data life cycle, you will likely be in a position to choose specific
file formats for your data and your data sources – for example, the
format chosen for preservation may differ from the format needed for
analysis. </p>
<p>File formats are generally represented as part of a file name, using
a file extension. Common file formats for data with which you might be
familiar include .xlsx, .csv, .xml, .spss, .Rdata, .shp, .json, etc.
Common file formats for data sources range widely; finding the best
format(s) may require consultation with peers in the field. For sources
that are routinely preserved by memory institutions (image, audio,
video, etc.), national bodies often provide extensive guidance. </p>

<h3 id="general-considerations">General Considerations</h3>
<p><strong><em>Open vs. Proprietary Formats</em></strong> </p>
<p>File formats may be free (open) or proprietary. Proprietary file
formats are owned and controlled by a company or organization that
limits their use, while open formats are freely published and available
for public use without charge. In general, in the context of research,
open formats are preferred as these enable practices related to
transparency, reproducibility, and access. However, in some cases
proprietary formats are so widely adopted that they become de facto
standards in many disciplines, and in some cases are released in ways
that allow them to mirror open options (e.g. Microsoft Word documents
for manuscripts, Shapefiles for GIS data, etc). In these cases it can be
hard or unwise to avoid their use. </p>
<p><strong><em>Portability</em></strong> </p>
<p>A file’s portability refers to how transferable it is across
different hardware, operating systems, and applications. This is
important for data sharing, since people who reuse your data might not
have access to the same hardware and software as you, but it is also
important for ensuring your own access in the future or on different
devices. These aspects of data sharing also improve data transparency,
research reproducibility, and open access. </p>
<p>Common characteristics of good options for portable file types
include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>being an open standard, so they can be manipulated without
needing access to proprietary software </p></li>
<li><p>having widespread adoption and common usage, so other researchers
will be used to handling them </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Persistence</em></strong> </p>
<p>Over time, file formats change and risk becoming obsolete, which can
make accessing older files a challenge. For long-term access and storage
of your data, it is therefore important to choose file formats that are
more likely to remain in use. In general, formats with the following
characteristics are most likely to be accessible in the future: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Non-proprietary </p></li>
<li><p>Openly documented standard </p></li>
<li><p>Popular </p></li>
<li><p>Uncompressed </p></li>
<li><p>Unencrypted </p></li>
<li><p>Standard encoding (ASCII, Unicode) </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Proliferation</em></strong> </p>
<p>In the interest of simplifying your workflow, it is usually best to
minimize the number of file formats you use and need to support at any
given stage in the research life cycle. The proliferation of formats
offering similar capabilities but requiring different software to
read/modify complicates workflows without necessarily offering much
benefit to the user. </p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>There may be instances in the research life cycle when it makes more
sense at one stage of a project to use one file format over another.
There are many possible reasons for this, including that a specific file
format may be required for analyses, or you may be working with research
partners that have limited access to software. In such situations, you
may find yourself going back and forth or possibly even maintaining
copies of your data or source files in more than one format. </p>
<p>As an example, when actively collecting and recording tabular data,
Microsoft Excel (a proprietary option) may be the default tool of choice
in most institutions. However, when analyzing this data you may migrate
to a piece of statistical software, and store the data as a Stata, SPSS,
MatLab, or R data file (some of these proprietary and others open
standards), or to a qualitative coding tool, such as NVivo, which would
have you store the data in a project wrapper like .nvp or .nvpx.
Finally, when publishing this data to support a manuscript or funder
requirements, you would be encouraged to convert your data to a fully
open, highly portable format, like tab or comma separated value file
types, with supporting text based documentation with additional
metadata. </p>
<p>If working in a novel environment, selecting the ‘best’ file type may
be a challenge. In the days before the dominance of Microsoft’s suite of
applications, a variety of competing, proprietary file formats were in
common use. Now that many of Microsoft’s file formats have become de
facto standards, accessing the data in those other proprietary file
formats, generally considered obsolete, is increasingly more difficult
if not impossible for most intents and purposes. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it is important to select a file type that is most suited
to the task at hand and to know what limitations exist when converting
between file types. </p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If possible, collect data in open and non-proprietary
formats  </p></li>
<li><p>If not possible to collect using open / non-proprietary formats,
try to pick a format that can be easily converted to an open
format </p></li>
<li><p>Consider software and formats that are widely used within your
discipline </p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of software, hardware, and licensing requirements for
viewing and working with data </p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of using elements such as colour or highlighting as a
form of metadata, as they may be lost if converted to a different
format </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-on-plain-text">A Note on Plain Text</h3>
<p>Whether qualitative or quantitative in nature, a lot of research data
is text based. This text based data can be stored in many different file
types and encoded in many different ways. A file format or file type
describes a file’s structure and consequently how the data are
displayed, and relationships between data represented, by an
application. A file encoding describes how the data are encoded in a
series of bytes (0s and 1s) in memory. </p>
<p><strong><em>File format = file structure</em></strong> </p>
<p>In a .csv file, data values are separated by commas, as in the
following .csv text example: </p>
<p>variable_1,variable_2,variable_3 </p>
<p>1,3,5 </p>
<p>7,9,13  </p>
<p>This will be rendered by spreadsheet-handling software like Microsoft
Excel to look something like: </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>variable_1</th>
<th>variable_2</th>
<th>variable_3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><em>File encoding = data</em></strong> </p>
<p>In a binary encoding system that transmits data in 8 bit chunks (what
your computer does), the following eight bits, 01101101, could represent
any number of things. If we know these eight bits represent UTF-8
encoding, then we know that these eight bits represent the lower case
letter m. In a csv structured file, with UTF-8 encoding, the latter
allows us to interpret the nature of the data (characters) while the
former allows us to interpret structure (each value is separated by a
comma). </p>
<p>There are multiple text-encoding standards that have been produced,
UTF-8 is perhaps the most widely used, alongside ASCII. UTF-8 and ASCII
encoding can be employed in many differently structured file formats,
including text files, .txt, comma separated value files, .csv, tab
separated value files, .tsv, extended markup language files, .xml,
hypertext files, .html, JavaScript Object Notation files, .json,
etc. </p>
<p>When a file is encoded in UTF-8 or ASCII in a file format that only
uses character encoding, it is referred to as plain text. The benefit of
plain text file formats is that even if the file format – the
documentation related to structure – is lost, the file can still be
opened by any application that can read ASCII or UTF-8 encoding; the
data have extremely strong permanence. </p>
<p><strong><em>UTF-8 and ASCII</em></strong> </p>
<p>The ASCII standard encodes the representation of 128 characters; all
letters in the English alphabet, the numbers 0-9, punctuation used in
English, and a series of what are called non-printing characters - bytes
that indicate the end of a line, a space, etc. This is an early standard
with a long history that predates computers and that is still in wide
use today, making it extremely robust. It is for this reason that, for
example in file naming, it is suggested to limit the choice of
characters to letters in the English alphabet and numbers 0-9; these
file names are extremely portable across systems, if lacking in language
diversity. </p>
<p>The UTF-8 standard is significantly larger and encodes the
representation of many, many more characters, striving to support all
languages. UTF-8 is what is used on the world wide web, allowing for a
truly multilingual experience. UTF-8 is fully backwards compatible with
ASCII, which means an application expecting a UTF-8 encoded file will be
able to open an ASCII encoded file without issue. UTF-8 is the preferred
choice for file encoding. </p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-file-compression">A Note on File Compression</h3>
<p>In the context of research data, files that are not plain text are
likely either a container of files or a compressed file. Containers hold
multiple individual files but represent them as if they were a single
thing. For example, Microsoft Word documents, .docx, are in fact
containers holding multiple files that are rendered to the viewer as a
single file. These containers may or may not use compression. Compressed
files use techniques to reduce a file’s size while it is stored on a
hard drive. </p>
<p>A common approach to compression is to identify repeated pieces of
data and to bundle these together for a more compact and less redundant
articulation of the data in the file. Methods to achieve compression are
often grouped by being lossy or lossless. Lossless compression allows
for a complete re-creation of the original data when unpacked; in
contrast lossy compression methods lose data along the way. An image
stored as TIFF will be significantly larger than the same image stored
as JPEG; TIFF is lossless, JPEG is lossy. When decompressed no
information is lost in the TIFF image, but the same is not true for the
JPEG. Lossy and lossless file types are most frequently encountered when
working with digital image, audio, and video files. The choice of file
format for images, video, and audio are complex and generally more than
one file format is used. </p>
<p>Plain text files can also be compressed; this is especially valuable
when moving data or storing data for a long time as it reduces transfer
times and needed storage.</p>
