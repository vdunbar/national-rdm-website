<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>File naming, and file naming conventions, pertain to all digital
files that form part of your research, including data, manuscripts,
figures, etc. While following a convention or standard when naming files
both within and across projects further decreases the cognitive load
involved in finding and sorting what you are looking for, conventions
for each of these will likely differ even within a single project as
what is relevant to record in a manuscript’s file name will differ from
a file containing research data. Our focus in any examples here will be
on describing data, but the principles apply equally well to all digital
files. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implementation of well thought out file naming is integral to
well organized, described, and managed research. File names are the
first piece of readily accessible metadata available. The more we can
describe a file in its name, the less time we need to spend opening
files to find what we are looking for, and one of the primary purposes
of file naming is to save tedious time searching, allowing you to
recognize the content of a file with ease. </p>
<p>When properly implemented, file names ensure that files transferred
between computers, operating systems, and platforms maintain their
discoverability, integrity, and accessibility. Connected to this, file
names form the basis of how information in a folder, or directory, can
be sorted and parsed for access. Therefore, well named files interact
well with programmatic methods for handling files. </p>
<p>Two key concepts with file names are that they should be both human
interpretable – they will make sense to a human reading them – and
machine readable – they are structured in a way that a computer can be
instructed to make sense of them. These concepts are described in more
detail below. </p>
<h3 id="quick-guide">Quick Guide</h3>
<p>We will start with a quick reference, then break these down and
explain the processes behind them: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>File names should only contain letters in the English alphabet,
numbers from 0-9, dashes -, underscores _, and periods ., preferably
only one period. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not use spaces or special characters, such as # % &amp; &lt;
&gt; : ” / | ? * { } $ ! ’ @ + = </p></li>
<li><p>File names should be broken down into conceptual components –
elements – that are separated by underscores _. If more than one word is
needed in each conceptual component, these can be separated by dashes
-. </p></li>
<li><p>Concepts recorded in a file name may include a project
descriptor, a descriptor of what is in the file, the name of the creator
or author, a date, a version number, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>File names should be all lowercase. </p></li>
<li><p>Concepts – or elements – of a file name should be ordered by what
is considered most important to the group. </p></li>
<li><p>All of these elements should be meaningful and described in
documentation. </p></li>
<li><p>All file names should end with a file type extension. </p></li>
<li><p>File naming conventions should be documented. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>**File names should only contain letters in the English alphabet,
numbers from 0-9, dashes -, underscores _, and periods ., preferably
only one period.** </p>
<p>When operating in a multilingual or non-English environment, using
only English letters can prove problematic. The implementation of
character encoding and localization (character representation in a local
language, such as accents or non-roman characters) is a complex subject
that is beyond the scope of this text, but it is because of localization
that in general, it is advised that file names be restricted to those
characters not deemed ‘special’ and that are supported by the ASCII
standard, which leaves us with the letters of the English alphabet, the
numbers 0-9, and underscores, dashes, and periods. The ASCII standard is
described in more detail in the chapter on file types. Ultimately, this
guidance is about ensuring that files can be moved between computers
with as much ease as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Do not use spaces or special characters, including # % &amp;
&lt; &gt; : ” / | ? * { } $ ! ’ @ + =</strong> </p>
<p>The reason we do not use these characters is because they often have
reserved meaning in computing environments, such as as operators (+, *,
/) or to designate specific operations (boolean logic, sets, variable
place holders, etc). The dash, interpretable as a minus sign, is one
exception to this. A space is considered a special character in this
context, since in many computing environments a space designates the end
of one thing and the beginning of another.  </p>
<p>**File names should be broken down into conceptual components –
elements – that are separated by underscores _. If more than one word is
needed in each conceptual component, these can be separated by dashes
-.** </p>
<p>Since spaces are considered a special character, it is convenient to
have a way to visually introduce spaces. Convention suggests that
underscores and hyphens are the characters of choice for this job. When
introducing spaces in a file name, these spaces may be used to separate
words relating to the same concept (i.e. an author’s name) or different
concepts (i.e. an author’s name followed by a date). We suggest that
concepts with more than one word be strung together with a dash and that
different concepts be linked with an underscore. </p>
<p>Instead of a dash, you may encounter suggestions to use camelback,
which strings together words through capitalization, like this,
camelBack. However, we discourage the use of capital letters in the
context of file naming (see below for more details), and so do not
promote this method. </p>
<p>There are a handful of instances in which an underscore might not be
desirable, but these are rare in the context of RDM, and relate more to
developing content that is intended to be a web-based resource. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts recorded in a file name may include a project
descriptor, a descriptor of what’s in the file, the name of the creator
or author, a date, a version number, etc.</strong> </p>
<p>Determine early on what metadata should be recorded in file names;
these elements may differ between file content types (ie manuscript,
data, output of analysis), between data collection methods
(observational, experimental, survey, sensor etc), and analysis tool
(manual coding (Excel), software assisted (NVivo), scripted (R, Python
etc). Common concepts to record in a file name include the project
itself, or an abbreviated version of it, the name of the author, the
name of the subject, the date of collection, the date of modification,
the version, etc. </p>
<p>When recording dates in a file name, these should be recorded as a
set of 8 numbers, the first four for the year, the next two for the
month, and the last two for the day. When a month or day is a single
digit, these should be preceded by a 0. For example, January 3, 2023
would be recorded as 20230103. When done in this order, dates will
always be sorted properly. </p>
<p>Recording a version number, or ordering files by number, should be
done with place holders for at least 2 digits, with single digit entries
being preceded by a 0. As with dates, when done in this order, numbers
will always be sorted properly by a computer. For example, version-03
and version-13 will be sorted in order, but version-3 and version-13
risk being out of order. </p>
<p><strong>File names should be all lowercase.</strong> </p>
<p>Some operating systems are case sensitive and some are not. This can
be problematic if you have to move files between computers with
different operating systems; a common occurrence in academia where
personal computers may be Macs, IT supported lab infrastructure on
Windows, and Advanced Research Computing infrastructure on Linux. </p>
<p>When operating systems are not case sensitive, the file titled
my-research-project.docx and MY-RESEARCH-PROJECT.docx will be treated as
the same file name, which risks you overwriting the one file with the
other unintentionally if you move these files from a case sensitive
environment to one that is not. This issue is easily resolved by
avoiding capitalization in file naming. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts – or elements – of a file name should be ordered by
what is considered most important to the group.</strong> </p>
<p>Depending on the file and situation, the author, date, project name,
etc. may or may not be the most relevant piece of information needed
when looking at a directory full of files. Rank the hierarchy of the
information you need to provide in a file name and develop a convention
that adheres to this prioritization. This order, and the scope of
metadata recorded in the file name, will likely differ from files
containing data, outputs of analyses, manuscripts, etc. </p>
<p><strong>All of these components should be meaningful.</strong> </p>
<p>In this context, meaningful refers to a file name being human
interpretable and machine readable. This is described in more detail
below. </p>
<p><strong>All file names should end with a file type extension and file
extensions should be separated from the rest of the file name with a
period.</strong> </p>
<p>A file type extension is the primary indicator of the type of
application that will be able to open a given file. This information is
used as much by a human reading the file as it is by an operating system
trying to decide which program to open that .docx or .jpeg file with.
The reason for the period is to help your operating system identify the
file type with a known designator. </p>
<p>The reality is that a file extension is simply part of a file name.
Generally, a file extension is created when a program generates a file.
But if, for example, we select options to hide file extensions and then
move these files between computers and operating systems, we risk losing
the file extension as part of the file name along the way. While not
irreversible, since we now know that we can simply add an extension, as
this is part of the file name, it can create unnecessary headaches. </p>
<p>If you want to see this principle in action, find a pdf, rename it to
end in docx (you will probably get a warning from your operating system,
but that is ok), and try opening it. To resolve what you have done,
simply rename the file again to end in .pdf. </p>
<p><strong>File naming conventions should be documented.</strong> </p>
<p>All file naming conventions should be documented, describing the
standard and how to implement and interpret it; see the section on
documentation for advice on how and where to do this. </p>
<h3 id="human-interpretable-machine-readable">Human Interpretable &amp;
Machine Readable</h3>
<p>File names need to achieve two primary goals: they need to make sense
to a human reading them, and they need to be constructed in a way that
allows a computer to parse or process them. That is, file names should
be human interpretable and machine readable. </p>
<p><strong><em>Human interpretable</em></strong>  </p>
<p>A file name needs to be conceptually meaningful to be human
interpretable. To do this, it needs to convey some basic information to
a person reading it. We do this, as noted above, by integrating metadata
into the file name in conceptual blocks. The metadata elements will be
dependent on the file, the project, and lab preferences, but should
probably include things such as: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who created the file </p></li>
<li><p>The date on which it was created </p></li>
<li><p>The project to which it is connected </p></li>
<li><p>The nature of the contents of the file </p></li>
<li><p>If it has been modified </p></li>
<li><p>The type or format of the file </p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is, you should be able to look at a file name and tell who
created it, when it was created, what it is related to, what is inside
of it, if it has been updated, and what application you should expect to
use to open it. </p>
<p>By using underscores _ to break up the metadata in a file name and by
always using the same patterns, we quickly become attuned to these
patterns, and picking out specific files from a long list becomes
increasingly easy. </p>
<p>[possible image of marked up file name] </p>
<p><strong><em>Machine readable</em></strong>  </p>
<p>A file name that is machine readable or machine interpretable means
creating file names in such a way that they can be sorted by an
application along specified delimiters. This means building names
according to set patterns, which can then be parsed, and if necessary,
described. It also means building our names in such a way that if you
move them from one computer to another, from one application to another,
or from one operating system to another, the files remain interpretable
in exactly the same way. </p>
<p>By using underscores _ to break up the metadata in a file name and by
always using the same patterns, you can computationally isolate files
based on each of these attributes irrespective of the directory
structure in which we store them, and, for example, find all files from
a particular creator, project, or created on a specific date. </p>
<h3 id="building-a-file-naming-convention">Building a file naming
convention</h3>
<p>The type of data you are working with, and the way in which it is
collected, will play a large part in how file naming conventions are
determined. For example, with time series data, dates are extremely
important, whereas for participant data, participant IDs may be a key
element, while in automated data collection the ID of the sensor used
may be an integral identifier in a file name. </p>
<p>To keep things manageable, abbreviations can also be used, but keep
in mind that while convenient to write, these can be ambiguous to the
reader. </p>
<p>In the resources section you can find additional real-world
implementations of various file naming conventions used in different
disciplines and for different projects as well as how these conventions
are described in documentation. It is important to remember that these
are all conventions, derived to solve specific file organization
challenges, and that any convention is better than no convention.</p>
