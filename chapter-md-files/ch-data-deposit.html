<h2 id="data-deposit">Data Deposit</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-data-deposition">What is Data Deposition</h3>
<p>Data deposition is the act of putting your data in a repository that
is, generally, accessible by people outside of your research team.
Usually, this is done when a research project, or a noteworthy portion
of a research project, has wrapped up. This involves moving a copy of
your data from your active project storage locations, which you can read
more about in data storage, to a storage platform dedicated to
preserving data for long-term access and discovery. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-data-repository">What is a Data Repository</h3>
<p>A data repository is a digital platform that hosts data and research
materials alongside relevant metadata. It allows you to store, manage,
publish, and enable the discovery of your work. Many data repositories
support long-term preservation of files, and possibly some level of
curation to ensure that data and associated files meet a certain
standard of quality. </p>
<h3 id="why-would-i-deposit-my-data">Why Would I Deposit My Data</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why you may end up moving your data into a
repository. While the points below are not exhaustive, they provide a
strong overview of the various motivations to deposit data. </p>
<p><strong><em>Research is about more than reporting on
findings</em></strong> </p>
<p>Academic research has historically been measured on final outputs
such as publications. This landscape is changing; increasingly funders,
distributors, producers, and consumers of research are recognizing that
what goes into informing a final output is of equal value to many of the
pieces that go into generating those outputs, including not just data,
but other ancillary products such as data collection tools, data
cleaning processes etc. In a trusted repository, deposits are one way to
disseminate and receive recognition for these generated products when
they have been constructed in house and to ensure credit is given where
it is due when they have been re-used. </p>
<p><strong><em>Transparency and Reproducibility</em></strong> </p>
<p>The only way to verify the reported outcomes of any study is to be
able to see everything that went into producing those reported outcomes.
This would include access to things like data collections tools, the
collected data, and the tools or methods used to analyze these data. The
degree to which this is feasible, or even desirable, will be largely
disciplinary and project dependent. But a great way of enhancing the
transparency and reproducibility of your work is by depositing your
data. Read more about transparency and reproducibility in Why is
research data management important? </p>
<p><strong><em>Accelerating Research</em></strong> </p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for researchers to be working through similar
research questions, or focusing on topics that have significant overlap.
However, if data for these projects aren’t shared, every project must
essentially start from scratch in regards to data, which is a drain on
both time and financial resources. By opening up your data and sharing
it with a broader audience, you are supporting future research efforts,
and speeding up the rate at which certain research questions can be
answered. It is not uncommon for researchers to work exclusively with
previously collected data or to seek out similar data to what they’re
collecting to help validate their own data. </p>
<p><strong><em>Funder &amp; Publisher Mandates</em></strong> </p>
<p>A frequently encountered reason to deposit your data is because you
simply have to. Funders and publishers are increasingly requiring
involved projects to make their data as available as possible. This is
often driven by the same desires of transparency and reproducibility
that represent the foundation of good research. Whenever your project
secures funder support or is considering a relationship with publishers,
it is vital to evaluate their data deposition policies and make sure
that you can satisfy them. Data repositories can function both as a way
to satisfy requirements for data deposits, but also as a way to satisfy
data retention requirements. A benefit of several data repositories is
that they offer long-term preservation, as well as assigning a digital
object identifier (DOI) for the data, as a way to provide persistent
access. </p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-deposit">What Should I Deposit?</h3>
<p>This is a difficult question to address. We have discussed a number
of different iterations of data in this text, including original data,
which tends to be in a state not suited to analysis, ‘cleaned data’,
which would form the basis of analysis, ‘subsets of data’ which might be
used in specific applications, data you didn’t collect, data you don’t
own etc. </p>
<p>The most appropriate deposit will consequently factor in many
questions, starting with, is it yours to deposit? If you’re unsure about
the answer to this question, it is recommended you speak with your
Library to determine whether you are in a position to do so. Assuming
that you are in a position to deposit data, there are some general
guidelines below to help you consider what you might deposit. One of the
main factors to guide this decision should be based around identifying
why you are depositing the data, and what you are hoping others can gain
from it. </p>
<p><strong><em>Original Data</em></strong> </p>
<p>This term refers to the data you have collected in its uncleaned, or
unprocessed, form. This can be valuable to deposit if promoting the
transparency and validity of your results is of importance, as such a
deposit allows for a more fulsome story of the journey of your data from
collection to preparation for analysis, to interpretation, helping to
limit or elucidate bias. </p>
<p><strong><em>Cleaned Data</em></strong> </p>
<p>This is data that has undergone some form of processing, formatting,
or general “cleaning”, to help give the data shape and structure to
allow for analysis and potential subsetting, whether this be the final
set of categorical tags used in coding transcripts or the results of
normalizing a tabular data set. This can be valuable to deposit if
allowing others to query the data that you have gathered and
contributing to academic discourse is of importance. These can also help
build larger datasets for further inquiry; consider for example deposit
in platforms like GenBank or GBIF which are global deposit sites for
cleaned, disciplinary connected data. Additionally, this can be a way to
share de-identified or otherwise treated sensitive data that shouldn’t
otherwise be made public. </p>
<p><strong><em>Data Subsets</em></strong> </p>
<p>This is data that could either be original or cleaned, but only
represents a portion of the data that you have collected. Depositing
this can be valuable for the same reasons as depositing the full version
of either original or cleaned data, but noting that you may still be
working through other sections of the data and you do not necessarily
want your work to get “scooped”. This can also include removing
sensitivities from your data that shouldn’t be made public. Data
deposited to support publication is frequently a subset of all data
collected. </p>
<p><strong><em>Supporting Materials &amp;
Documentation</em></strong> </p>
<p>A key aspect in ensuring that your data is interpretable to those
outside of your research group is including proper documentation to
support your data (for more info, see Documentation). In addition to
including the necessary documentation and metadata, it is also very
helpful to include any ancillary products, such as dictionaries,
scripts, or details regarding software that were used to help generate
your results. </p>
<p><strong><em>File Formats</em></strong> </p>
<p>Depositing files in popular non-proprietary formats will ensure that
the widest possible audience can access and open them, hopefully for
years to come. While this isn’t always possible, we encourage you to
consult the File Formats section for information and recommendations to
help facilitate this. </p>
<h3 id="where-should-i-deposit-my-data">Where Should I Deposit My
Data?</h3>
<p>There is an increasingly large number of data repositories, and
finding the right one can be challenging. This section will attempt to
address the kinds of repositories that exist and some of the limitations
of a variety of repositories, with the goal of providing you with the
key questions to ask of your institution’s research support team and
peers when you’re looking for an appropriate place to deposit your
data. </p>
<p><strong><em>Repository Categories</em></strong> </p>
<p>Data repositories can be grouped in several ways. </p>
<p>One is by intended purpose:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>to support publication and funder requirements </p></li>
<li><p>to support further research on similar data collected by many
research teams </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another is by scope of accepted content:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>some, generalist repositories, will accept anything </p></li>
<li><p>others, disciplinary repositories, will only accept data related
to specific areas of research </p></li>
<li><p>others, research domain specific repositories, will only accept
data related to specific kinds of inquiry, like sequences from genetic
sequencing. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another is by owner, funder, or administrative structure:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>some are institution specific - many post-secondary institutions
have their own hosting repository </p></li>
<li><p>some are government funded and coordinated </p></li>
<li><p>some are owned and managed by societies or other non-governmental
agencies </p></li>
<li><p>some are owned and managed by corporate entities involved in some
aspect of the research life cycle, perhaps most notably in the realm of
publication. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>These categories are not mutually exclusive, but can help you ask the
right questions when looking for a place to deposit. For example,
indicating why you are depositing, whether there is value in your data
living alongside other disciplinary related data, and how close you want
your data to your research institution, a publisher, or disciplinary
related society. When there is this much choice, there is no right or
wrong answer, but perhaps sometimes a better or less than ideal
answer. </p>
<p><strong><em>Repository Evaluation</em></strong> </p>
<p>In addition to selecting an appropriate ‘type’ of repository,
repositories will, like any piece of software, offer various features,
some limiting, some essential for your kind of research data.
Consequently, important general considerations to keep top of mind when
looking at a repository include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maximum file size supported </p></li>
<li><p>Maximum dataset size allowed </p></li>
<li><p>Cost </p></li>
<li><p>Data licensing requirements </p></li>
<li><p>Data preservation considerations </p></li>
<li><p>User accessibility </p></li>
<li><p>Data privacy and security </p></li>
<li><p>Repository reputation </p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure and planning for the repository’s continued
existence </p></li>
<li><p>Metadata accessibility </p></li>
<li><p>Data use and citation metrics  </p></li>
<li><p>Curation of datasets to maintain high quality standards and
general organization </p></li>
<li><p>Data provenance recording </p></li>
<li><p>Data interaction capabilities </p></li>
</ul>
<p>While these criteria are important, you may not have a lot of control
over them depending on what repositories are available for your specific
needs. </p>
<h3 id="finding-a-repository">Finding a Repository</h3>
<p>Once you know what you need in a repository, the next step is to find
an appropriate repository that meets these needs! A quick search on your
favourite search engine will demonstrate the plethora of repositories
available, which in turn can be frustrating to navigate. </p>
<p>Generally, your institution will have a number of generalist
repositories that they recommend and for which you can easily get
answers to all of the considerations posed above. And generally, these
repositories are under the purview of the library. Your library will
also likely have familiarity with certain disciplinary repositories and
can help guide you through these. When it comes to highly specialized
repositories, often a bit more investigation is needed, and consultation
with peers in your discipline. </p>
<p>If you are interested in exploring more broadly but with some
guidance, there are also many curated lists of repositories; recommended
lists are available in the resources section of this chapter. </p>
<h3 id="sensitive-data">Sensitive Data</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, repositories are not suitable for sensitive data.
This is because most of the repositories that you will come across are
hosted in the cloud and connected to the Internet, creating an inherent
security risk. But there are caveats to this. Some repositories store
your data and meta data independently of each other, allowing your
research data to be securely protected, but your metadata readily
accessible. This allows for discoverability of your data, but not direct
access; access can be handled on a request by request basis. </p>
<p>Many repositories are increasingly exploring the role of encryption
in the deposit of sensitive data; this is an ongoing area of
inquiry. </p>
<p>If your data are sensitive, but would benefit from discoverability
through metadata alongside potential restricted access upon request,
this should ideally be investigated on a case by case basis. Your
institution’s library or research computing units should be your first
point of contact.</p>
