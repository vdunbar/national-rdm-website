<h2 id="file-permissions-and-ownership">File Permissions and
Ownership</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>This section addresses assigning and understanding user roles as they
relate to files that are stored digitally. For a discussion on
permissions and ownership in a legal or social framework, see the
sections on licencing and partnership research. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maintaining access permissions to digital files is a critical
component of any project for a variety of reasons. Datasets, especially
those with sensitive or personal information, have the potential to be
exposed to unauthorized people, causing a variety of negative
consequences. Furthermore, access permissions and ownership enable an
explanation of where data came from and who modified it, allowing user
errors to be detected and corrected. </p>
<p>The granting of access and permissions can exist in the storage
platforms, software, and physical devices (laptops, hard drives, etc.,)
that you are using. More complex projects with sensitive data can
require more complex solutions, which may require working with your
institutional support offices, or potentially hiring somebody to manage
these. </p>
<p>Most cloud storage platforms allow for easy permission setting at the
file and folder levels. </p>
<h3 id="access-and-permissions-management">Access and Permissions
Management</h3>
<p>Not everyone involved in a given project necessarily needs or should
have access to every aspect of that project. </p>
<p>When preparing for a research project and mapping out the directory
structure and storage locations that will be used, you should think
about the following roles and which should have access to what parts of
a project: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Primary investigator </p></li>
<li><p>Lead researcher </p></li>
<li><p>Lab manager </p></li>
<li><p>Research collaborators </p></li>
<li><p>Graduate research assistants </p></li>
<li><p>Undergraduate research assistants </p></li>
<li><p>Funders </p></li>
<li><p>Editors and Reviewers </p></li>
<li><p>The public </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the makeup of your group, some of these actors may not
be relevant, and some may need further breakdown when thinking about
roles in the research project and access and permission needs. </p>
<h3 id="levels-of-access">Levels of Access</h3>
<p>Most systems allow three levels of access: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Administrator or owner </p></li>
<li><p>Read and write </p></li>
<li><p>Read-only </p></li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, (1) <strong>administrators</strong> have full control over
whatever they preside on, whether at the project, directory, or file
level. At the project level, they can generally invite and remove
collaborators and make public or delete files. (2) <strong>Read and
write</strong> will allow a user or person to open (read) and edit
(write) existing files. Depending on the system, read and write may
allow users to delete, create, or make public files and directories.
Generally, read and write does not allow invitation or deletion of
collaborators. However, you should ask these questions about whatever
storage solution you use to house your research. (3)
<strong>Read-only</strong> generally only allows for the opening of a
file, without the ability to edit, delete, or invite additional
collaborators. </p>
<p>One additional level of access is anonymous access. It is becoming
increasingly common to support activities like the double-blind peer
review process. Generally, this access is read only, providing peer
reviewers with access to data and other supplementary files, but in a
way that hides the identity of those who have created or worked on those
files. </p>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<p>Closely related to access is the notion of file and folder
ownership. It is common that the owner will be the creator of the file
or folder. In some cases, a user can create a file or folder in a
location they are not the owner of, and ownership will be granted to the
owner of the location (i.e. the folder or project containing the newly
created file or folder). </p>
<h3 id="levels-of-knowledge">Levels of Knowledge</h3>
<p>It is worth considering two other potential levels associated with
file permissions and access: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knowing something exists </p></li>
<li><p>No knowledge </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although awareness of information does not inherently merit
documentation, it can be valuable to control even rudimentary knowledge
around sensitive data. An example of knowing something exists would be
an undergraduate research assistant knowing there is a project budget
but having no access to the documentation. Correspondingly, no knowledge
access is exemplified by a project having a need-to-know basis for
sensitive data, wherein unconnected project members or collaborators
have neither access nor awareness of data outside their work. </p>
<p>Even when someone cannot read a file’s contents, we may wish to make
them aware of its existence. Publishing, or making publicly available, a
copy of your directory structure, is one way of doing this; you may be
able to see the names of individual files and perhaps a readme file that
describes the contents of the file but does not actually reveal these
contents. This may be useful in a data sharing scenario, where you may
be willing or in a position to share your data upon request. A request
can only come if someone knows there is something there to request. </p>
<p>[image of directory structure indicating who has access to what] </p>
<p>When all data and metadata are stored on private media or are
unpublished, non-collaborators will have zero knowledge of any of your
research data or other files. </p>
<p>Directory access permissions should be articulated based on
collaborator roles during project preparation. In the event that storage
systems support file-level permission control, any specific
file-permissions should also be considered and articulated. A registry
for collaborator permissions should always be maintained, listing all
collaborators, their roles, and their access permissions. When leaving a
project, collaborators should have their permissions and access
updated. </p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Different storage solutions, cloud platforms, operating systems, and
applications will have different options and methods for implementing
file and folder permissions and controlling ownership of resources. In
fact, aspects of permission and ownership may not be within your control
on infrastructure provided to you by your institution. </p>
<p>If you are using a set-up that is supported by your institution,
directly contacting the responsible unit(s) and reviewing their support
documentation is the best way to learn about how the platforms work. It
is not uncommon for institutional implementations to differ from
publicly available implementations of the same system.</p>
