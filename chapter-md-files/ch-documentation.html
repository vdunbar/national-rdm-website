<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation provides a critical role in describing data and the
contents of files, whether this be as a memory jog, to facilitate
onboarding or other information sharing, to enhance the reproducibility
and transparency of your work, or to let others know how they may or may
not use what you have generated. Without documentation, data are, for
all intents and purposes, meaningless at best and useless at worst. </p>
<p>In the section on file naming, we saw that when naming files, you
provide a base level of documentation through metadata embedded in these
file names and described by file naming conventions. Even so, only so
much information is stored in a file name, and our naming conventions
need to be documented somewhere to be implemented and understood. In the
context of research data management, this means creating at a minimum
four files: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>readme</strong> file that resides in your <strong>root
folder</strong> and elaborates on the contents of your folder
structure. </p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>readme</strong> file that resides in your <strong>data
directory</strong> and discusses some of the particulars of the how,
where, and who did the actual data collection. </p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>data dictionary</strong> or <strong>codebook</strong>
file that also resides in your data directory and elaborates on the kind
of data you have, at the variable level. </p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>licence</strong> file that resides in your <strong>root
folder</strong> and details how others may or may not re-use your
research data and associated files. </p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>The role of the readme and the data dictionary, or codebook, that
reside in a data directory are generally distinct. The readme is
intended to describe the data’s provenance - when and by whom were the
data collected - while the data dictionary is intended to describe the
variables (data types, variable descriptions, etc.). It is very possible
that in certain circumstances this differentiation across two files is
not necessary, and the information can be contained in a single file.
Aspects of this are described in more detail below. </p>
<p>A single licence file may not suffice for many projects, and may only
be needed at a point when data are moved from an area of restricted
access to one of more public access, such as when depositing data to
support a publication. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="general-considerations">General Considerations</h3>
<p>It is important that these files stand out, as they are the first
things one should look at when opening any directory or folder. There
are several ways that we might achieve this. If you primarily use the
Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (PC) to navigate your files,
pre-prepending the file names with an underscore, <code>_</code>, can
help to push the files to the top of the list when files are displayed
alphabetically. Another technique is to use capital case when naming
these files. This is in contradiction to the recommendations in the file
naming section that encourages use of only lower-case characters, but
may work for specific situations. The alternative is to simply use lower
case without a prepended underscore. The most important thing is
consistency. The second most important thing is to use a convention that
facilitates your work or conventions in your discipline, if there are
any. </p>
<p>If we agree that data without documentation are meaningless, then it
follows that it is important that documentation be stored in file
formats that will have longevity in storage. It is also important that
the documentation be portable; in general, this means writing
documentation in plain text. For the purposes of a readme file, this
means with a .txt or .md file extension, and for a data dictionary,
.txt, .md, .csv, .xml, .json, .yml, etc. More information about these
file types can be found in file formats. </p>
<h3 id="root-folder-readme">Root Folder readme</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document, at a bare minimum, is to describe the
directory structure of your project. To adequately describe your
directory structure, you should include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>A brief description of the project or the purpose of the root
folder </p></li>
<li><p>The date when the root folder was created and who created
it </p></li>
<li><p>The date when the readme file was last updated and who updated
it </p></li>
<li><p>A brief description of the contents of each major folder within
the root folder </p></li>
<li><p>A brief description of file naming conventions used within the
directory </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-directory-readme">Data Directory Readme</h3>
<p>The purpose of this readme file is to provide a description of data
collection methods. It will include, at a minimum: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The date when the data directory was created and who created
it </p></li>
<li><p>The date when the readme file was updated and who updated
it </p></li>
<li><p>A brief description of each data that was collected, the methods
used for collection, and the date range for when each dataset was
collected </p></li>
<li><p>A description of who was involved in data collection </p></li>
<li><p>A brief description of where the data were collected </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-dictionaries-codebooks">Data Dictionaries &amp;
Codebooks</h3>
<p>A data dictionary or codebook helps others understand the meaning of
each element in your datasets. Most importantly, this includes
explaining what all the variable names and values in your dataset really
mean. Typically, you will have an individual data dictionary for each
dataset, if you have more than one dataset. </p>
<p>Data dictionaries may be written in an unstructured document –
interpretable by a human, but not a computer program – or in a
structured document – interpretable by both a human and computer
program. An unstructured document would communicate the above details
simply as prose. A structured document would communicate the above
through some form of meta data that has set rules for how meta data are
separated from the values of interest (for example,
<code>first_name</code> might be a meta data element, while, in the case
of one of the authors of this text, <code>Jordan</code>, would be a
value associated with this). Structured formats may adhere to standards,
which will be discussed later. For a more in depth discussion of the
difference between human and computer interpretable ways of articulating
information, refer to the section on file naming. </p>
<p>From the list of plain text file formats above, .txt and .md are
generally suitable for unstructured data dictionaries or codebooks,
while the others are suitable for structured data dictionaries and
codebooks. </p>
<p>Your data dictionary or codebook should include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The date when the data dictionary was created and who created
it </p></li>
<li><p>The date when the data dictionary file was updated and who
updated it </p></li>
<li><p>A description of each variable, including data type, units,
number of levels if categorical, and a description of variable levels
where relevant </p></li>
<li><p>When describing variables you need to provide the full names and
definitions of each variable because often variables are abbreviated in
datasets. This is of particular note for things like survey
questions. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metadata-standards">Metadata Standards</h3>
<p>The primary reason for storing data dictionaries and codebooks in a
structured format is to facilitate interacting with these with a
computer program. Just like with file naming conventions, patterns allow
for programmatic parsing of information; structured documents follow
known patterns. Moving a step beyond structured documents, you can use
standardized metadata implementations and standardized vocabularies to
further enhance how easily this information is moved between systems;
this is the I - interoperable - in FAIR. Metadata standards generally
provide a controlled way of identifying and describing aspects of one’s
data, such as: what’s a variable, what’s a scale, what are the possible
values (levels or range) that may be assigned to a variable etc.
Standardized vocabularies are perhaps less common and provide a preset
number of valid values that a variable might take. When using
standardized implementations, it is not necessary for you to describe
how your metadata is structured, instead you simply refer to the
standard. </p>
<p>Some disciplines have more robust standards implemented than others.
A handful of common standards include the Data Documentation Initiative
(DDI), for survey data, schema.org for describing entities on the web,
and DarwinCore for describing biological collections. </p>
<p>It is very likely that in the context of a small research project,
the use of a standard may seem unwarranted. However, if a research lab
routinely collects similar data across many studies, aggregating these
data across studies in accordance with a standard can be hugely
beneficial. These standards will also come into play if the data with
which you work is well suited to deposit in aggregating databases of
research data. </p>
<p>If the data that you and your lab work with is suitable for deposit
and sharing, you should consider how you can move from simply
documenting your data to documenting your data using a standardized
approach. The most relevant standard will likely be indicated by
whatever data repository you and or your lab decide to contribute to.
Some of these standards will allow you to specify labels all the way
down to the variable level (biological data with DarwinCore is an
excellent example, as taxonomic ranking is often a variable), others
will simply allow you to indicate that something is a variable and to
describe it (DDI is an excellent example, as a survey question is a
variable), and others will allow you to describe the data set as a
whole, but not its variables (schema.org is an excellent example, as
it’s designed to connect ‘objects’ on the web). </p>
<h3 id="qualitative-research-data">Qualitative Research Data</h3>
<p>The above discussion is of high relevance to quantitative data,
whether experimental, observational, survey-based etc. A data dictionary
or code book for qualitative research may likely look quite different.
Mapping themes to language, characteristics to objects etc., and having
a record of these, however, may still have strong relevance. </p>
<p>The important thing to recall is that the documentation that
surrounds data has a primary purpose of ensuring that the data has
meaning to you, the researcher, and those who might look at your data
alongside your findings (peers, reviewers, readers, etc.), and a
secondary purpose of being machine readable so as to be able to connect
it to similar data sets others have collected. If your data collection
is not an extension of other research, the latter may be of little
concern, but this is likely a rare occasion. </p>
<h3 id="other-readme-files">Other readme files</h3>
<p>It is advisable to have a readme in every directory. These readmes
should mirror the readme in your root folder, describing the contents of
the folder. As you progress from the root folder into subsequent sub
directories, the level of detail in a readme will increase. For example,
at the root level, the description of a data directory will likely read
something like ‘contains all data for the project’, while any
subdirectories in the data directory would articulate the specifics of
the kind of data held in those directories. </p>
<h3 id="licences">Licences</h3>
<p>The goal of including a licence, generally as licence.txt, is to be
able to clearly indicate how your data or other research outputs may be
used or re-used by others. A licence file is a good compliment to
project team internal discussions of intellectual ownership, the latter
outlining control and ownership within the research team, the former
guiding how those external to the project team can engage with the data
and associated products. </p>
<p>While a licence is of little utility before data are made publicly
available, how your data is collected and analyzed may impact the
licence that you are allowed to apply. It is advisable to pick a desired
licence at the outset of your project and then align all data collection
and processing activities to that licence, as opposed to trying to map a
licence retroactively onto your data. </p>
<p>See the section on ownership and licencing for more details on
licencing data and associated products.</p>
