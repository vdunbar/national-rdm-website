and utility of various mediums for data processing and preservation.

<p>Data need to be stored. A simple statement, but not one without its
complexities. Key aspects to data storage include access to the data by
the researcher or research team, an appropriate level of security for
the data being stored, and redundancy in storage solutions, i.e. having
back-ups. </p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Data storage is a complex issue involving file size determination,
privacy and security, storage tied to specific software applications,
with more and more of these applications operating in the cloud,
jurisdictional requirements, transfer considerations, etc. The following
is a relatively brief discussion of a few of these issues. </p>
<p>Often, your IT department will handle storage solutions used jointly
by researchers and administrative teams, forming the backbone of most
day-to-day storage options, while your Advanced Research Computing team
will handle research-specific storage solutions that cater to things
like large data transfer and storage or high-performance computing.
Finally, your library will handle data repositories that support long
term storage of data or storage to support outputs such as
publications. </p>
<p>Data storage can be grouped into several categories. One is by
medium, or the technology, used to store data. Another is by location of
these storage devices. And a third is by whether or not a storage
location allows one to actively work with data on that storage platform.
Each of these facets of data storage will play into how one implements
data storage for their research. </p>
<h3 id="storage-by-activity">Storage by Activity</h3>
<p>Generally, storage is conceptually divided into two activity
categories: active storage and long-term storage. </p>
<p><strong><em>Active Storage</em></strong></p>
<p>Ease of access is critical when actively working with data. For this
reason, active storage locations are generally close at hand, such as a
physical hard disk. This can also include active storage over a network,
whether that be an institutional network or the Internet. The further
the data need to travel (internal hard drive &lt; external hard drive
&lt; local network &lt; internet), the slower one’s access to these
data. </p>
<p>[possible image depicting speed of storage based on how far away it
is] </p>
<p>Active data storage options also need to account for who is working
with the data. One person, with one computer may be well served by an
internal hard drive. However, if that person is working off multiple
computers, or is working with collaborators within or outside their
institution, storage systems that are connected to a network or the
Internet are more practical. </p>
<p>Your primary active data location should balance this need for quick
access alongside distributed access. At the same time, increased
distribution heightens the risk of data being accessed by unintended
audiences. </p>
<p><strong><em>Long-term storage</em></strong> </p>
<p>Long-term storage generally refers to the storage of files after the
completion of a project, but can refer to storage of data for later
access in larger projects. </p>
<p>Compared to active storage, ease of access to long-term storage is
less important, since the files are no longer in frequent use and are
not undergoing frequent changes. However, long-term stability and
potentially discoverability by the wider community are of greater
concern. For this reason, long-term storage usually makes use of a
third-party data repository, which provides robust metadata schemas that
ensure that data are searchable and discoverable. Many also offer a
variety of embargo and restricted access options, including public
release of metadata only. Others offer convenient storage of extremely
large data sets. </p>
<p>Files in long term storage often need to be migrated to a different
storage medium and location to be worked on. </p>
<h3 id="storage-locations">Storage Locations</h3>
<p>Storage locations may be local or remote, both of which can be
beneficial. It is not uncommon to rely on both mediums as a way to
facilitate efficient data workflows and ensure data is backed up. </p>
<p><strong><em>Hard Drives</em></strong> </p>
<p>Hard drives can include both the storage on your personal computer
and external storage devices. These are often referred to as local
storage, and are often the simplest option for the active storage of
smaller to mid-range projects. A key benefit of hard drives is the ease
of access to data and files because no Internet connection is required,
and the files are directly accessible by your computer. </p>
<p>It is recommended to encrypt files on local devices, which helps keep
your data secure. As long as the devices remain in your possession, your
data’s privacy and security will be maintained. With that said, the
physical location in which you keep your computer(s) and external
device(s) will be a primary factor in upholding the privacy and security
of your data, and you want to always be conscious of who can access
them. Another privacy consideration with using local storage is when
traveling and crossing borders with data, as devices can be subject to
being searched. </p>
<p>A primary limitation of local storage is the difficulty of sharing
data with project collaborators. It is common to use local storage in
conjunction with remote storage to facilitate data sharing and to back
your data up. </p>
<p><strong><em>Network Storage</em></strong> </p>
<p>Network storage is a form of remote storage, usually made available
through institutions, and is likely hosted on-campus, but may be part of
shared services across multiple institutions and located at a partner
campus. </p>
<p>This type of storage is usually reserved for active data, but your
institution may also provide long-term network storage. Strengths of
this type of storage are that it will often meet any on-premise
requirements that your data may have, and it facilitates easy data
sharing with collaborators at your institution. Network storage is often
very private and secure, and because it is usually backed-up
automatically, it is valuable in safeguarding your data. </p>
<p>A drawback of network storage is that it can be challenging to share
with collaborators outside your institution, and is often limited to use
by faculty. Although network storage may be accessible through an
Internet connection off campus, the connection and data transfer are
usually not as fluid as with cloud storage. </p>
<p><strong><em>Cloud Storage</em></strong> </p>
<p>Cloud storage can be considered the most remote storage, as the data
can be hosted on servers worldwide. It is generally the easiest way to
share data with collaborators outside your institution and is usually
necessary in these types of collaborations. </p>
<p>The primary considerations with cloud storage revolve around privacy
and security restrictions, and it is worth knowing where the data is
being stored (domestically or internationally), and what security
measures the cloud provider supports. Cloud storage is almost always
provided by a third-party vendor (i.e. not actively managed by your
institution), and may have costs associated with it (either for your
institution or individuals), and therefore may not always be a viable
option. </p>
<h3 id="back-ups">Back ups</h3>
<p>Most data can not be reasonably or easily re-collected within a
single study, and losing data can be a challenge to recover from, so it
is important to secure multiple copies to safeguard against loss. </p>
<p>In the section on file naming we discuss strategies for managing
multiple copies and iterations of data files in a single storage
location. Here, we address the prevention of data loss with up-to-date
backups of your files, and how many copies of files and the locations of
these copies matters. </p>
<p>There are many approaches to backing up files. One common approach is
the 3-2-1 model:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p> <strong>3</strong> copies in </p></li>
<li><p> <strong>2</strong> formats (i.e. laptop hard drive and removable
hard drive) with </p></li>
<li><p> <strong>1</strong> stored off-site (i.e. a different physical
location to protect from physical damage or disasters) </p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will encounter other models. The important thing is that data are
in multiple physical locations and that backups are routine (i.e., 
scheduled back-ups). Whether the schedule is daily, weekly, bi-weekly,
etc. depends completely on how safe proof you would like to keep your
data. </p>
<p>While these backups can be maintained manually, automated backup
workflows are more convenient and, therefore, more likely to be used
regularly - ensuring that backed-up versions of files are always
current. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>Cloud storage can provide automatic backups and local syncing, but it
is not always the perfect solution we might hope it would be. </p>
<p>Historically, syncing often meant duplicating content in the cloud
with content on the synced device, but this is increasingly not the
case. Instead, a ‘just in time’ approach is used, where only files
actively being used are synced to your local machine. This means that
where once using cloud storage meant you had a backup system in place,
this may no longer be the case. </p>
<p>Syncing can also interfere with data processing. If you use an
application that does real time processing on your data (image editing,
audio editing, scripting, etc), these processes can conflict with
automatic syncing processes, which inadvertently update files between
local storage and the cloud. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="estimating-storage-space">Estimating Storage Space</h3>
<p>Accurately estimating storage space when you start your project is
crucial. You will need to allocate storage for original data, processed
and analyzed data, documentation that informs users about your data,
draft papers, charts, visualizations, photos, and supplementary items
that go within your papers. You will also need space for the
administrative documents of your project, such as grant applications.
Consult your with your institutional research support units if you are
uncertain about how to estimate your storage requirements. Arrange for
sufficient or additional storage well before it is actually required.
Sometimes you have instant access to needed additional storage; in other
cases, it takes time to gain access. </p>
<h3 id="data-privacy-and-security">Data Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>In file permissions and ownership we discuss implementing access
controls to data files, which is a key aspect of privacy. In this
section we talk more about security. Privacy relates to who can and
should have access to data and the risks associated with the release of
data beyond these individuals. Security refers to the technology used to
limit data exposure beyond those designated with access. Data may have
privacy concerns but not be secure, just as data may be secure but have
no privacy concerns. One’s institution generally governs the security of
the data storage infrastructure. A process known as a Privacy Impact
Assessment is how most institutions determine the suitability of a
specific piece of software or storage solution for specific data related
activities. </p>
<p><strong><em>Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)</em></strong> </p>
<p>A privacy impact assessment is a risk management and review process
that mitigates threats to data security and unnecessary privacy
violations. Depending on your jurisdiction or local policy, they may be
required when using a new service or piece of software for a project.
They may also be suggested or required during data access requests, for
example when requesting access to highy sensitive data from a health
authority or other government body.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Public and External Access
Considerations</em></strong> </p>
<p>The nature of external or public access to a project is also
significant to a project’s data management. It is important to have an
awareness of the information privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which
you work. Data access and permissions are especially important when
sensitive data are involved, and ensuring adequate privacy is maintained
through appropriate security measures should be a fundamental objective
of the project from its inception. In terms of public and external
access, consider: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data access requirements should reflect institutional policies
and mandates </p></li>
<li><p>Access standards may be affected by grant-specific
requirements </p></li>
<li><p>Providing information about institutional data access policies
and mechanisms for external interest </p></li>
<li><p>Any ethical obligations or desires of research participants and
collaborators.</p></li>
</ul>
