Copyright, Licensing, Control, Access, and Reuse</h2>
<p>The collection, storage, use, and dissemination of research data as
they relate to ownership, copyright, licencing, control, access, and
reuse are influenced and governed by many frameworks within multiple
jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions stand in contradiction or in conflict
with each other. It is a complex landscape. This chapter explores some
of these issues, points to sources of information or tools to facilitate
navigating research data ownership, copyright, licencing, access, and
reuse. </p>
<p>In a Western legal framework, the dominant structure governing
academia, data have been tied to both concepts of common knowledge as
well as intellectual property. In their original form, many data are
deemed not to be owned; for example, environmental data like
temperatures, or counting observations, like the number of pedestrians
crossing a street. This suggests that simply collecting data does not
bring with it intrinsic notions of ownership or control of that data.
Providing some intellectual enhancement to those data, however, may
protect that specific dataset through legal structures designed to
protect intellectual property rights; say that same temperature or count
data is cleaned, organized and packaged to enable specific types of
analyses; this package, within this framework, may be protected by
intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>Within western academic practices, collecting data - whether by
interview, body sensors, video footage, etc. - and determining
ownership, copyright, licencing, control, access, and reuse of these
data is governed by a whole series of other frameworks, some rooted in
western legal tradition and governed by, for example, institutions
(policies, standards, and guidelines to which employees and students
must adhere), funder mandates (legally binding funding agreements), and
partnerships (research agreements, which may be documents of good faith
or legally binding), while others are codified in systems of practice
that align with cultural norms through entities like research ethics
boards or disciplinary codes of ethics. These frameworks of research
data governance and ownership can cross jurisdictional boundaries;
research conducted across more than one institution may have misaligned
policies, standards, and guidelines and research conducted in more than
one country may have to reconcile different legal requirements. </p>
<p>Not all data are strictly governed by western legal traditions and
frameworks. More recently, academic institutions, particularly in a
colonial context, are recognizing that they must work within and
alongside frameworks that reside outside these traditions. In a colonial
context this means recognizing Indigenous sovereignty and respecting
Indigenous Peoples’ data; this is discussed in more detail elsewhere in
this text. </p>
<p>When working across multiple frameworks and jurisdictions,
researchers may encounter conflicts and contradictions and may struggle
to reconcile traditions, practices, and frameworks that simply do not
translate and that exist in contexts of deep-seated distrust. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>Not explicitly articulated above, but integral to much of the
discussion, relates to your data source. Your data source will likely
bring with it limitations on what you can do with that data whether
those limitations be rooted in legal systems, relationships, or
responsible and ethical approaches to the conduct of research. We often
articulate this in relation to people we work with, but gathering data
from texts or stories that are otherwise protected will impose similar
limits. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<p>Ownership in the context of research data is a messy topic. We start
with ownership here since copyright and licencing are predicated on
concepts of ownership. Yet, while it is true that copyright and
licencing are predicated on ownership, this is restricted to specific
legal frameworks that assign ownership to individuals or individual
entities, which is quite distinct from those frameworks that recognize
collective ownership and responsibility. </p>
<p>In the context of a graduate research lab, an important question you
should ask that relates to ownership is whether you are allowed to take
the data that underpins your research with you when you leave, whether
that is pursuing your career in your own lab at the same institution or
moving to a new institution. For this reason, it is important to discuss
with your supervisor how ownership of data is attributed. If your
research involves working with any partners, whether that be industry,
government, non-profit, ad-hoc etc, ownership of the data should be a
very early discussion. Ultimately, ownership will impact virtually every
aspect of control that you have over the research data - where it is
stored, how it is licenced, how it can be shared, etc. Documentation
should always be developed to attest to whatever agreements on data
ownership are put in place. </p>
<p>In addition to the above, aspects of ownership may be governed by
funding agreements, research agreements, and institutional policies. For
agreements, be sure you are familiar with and comfortable with whatever
is stipulated in these. It is likely that as a graduate student you will
not have direct access to your Office of Research Services, which is the
primary portal through which support for these would be provided. Your
supervisor or project primary investigator (PI) will by default then be
your primary support here. Institutional policies about data ownership
will be distributed through your Chief Information Officer (CIO), and
you should be able to find relevant policies, standards, and guidelines
through them. Interpretation of these documents is often another matter
and may require consultation with peers, mentors, and members of your
research support units. </p>
<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>Copyright is a specific legal construct found in western legal
practices and centered on a notion of the ownership of intellectual
property. It is important to note that copyright, ownership, and
licences are intertwined. This section is not about copyright per se,
but there are some relevant aspects of copyright to consider in the
context of research data and RDM. </p>
<p>In an academic context, interpretation of copyright law will be
handled by a dedicated legal team, and dissemination of this
interpretation is often handled through the institution’s library. </p>
<h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3>
<p>A data license, attached to a dataset governed by copyright, defines
what external parties may do with a dataset. A licence is a standard use
protocol; without a licence, anyone wishing to use a copyrighted object
would need to explicitly contact the copyright holder and negotiate a
term of use. Licencing data impacts the ease with which data may be
reused. A standard, well documented licence clearly and accessibly
communicates how research data may be used. Bespoke licences require
unique attention. The lack of a licence requires personal
communication. </p>
<p>It is important to note that some funding and publication agreements
require data sharing, and this requirement may include application of a
specific licence. It is prudent to fully comprehend any agreement and
its details related to data sharing in advance of signing off. </p>
<p>A variety of data license options exist to reflect different
requirements and desires, with different institutions, funding bodies,
and geographic organizations having their own preferences. It is often
more expedient to consult with experts at your institution when
considering which license to apply to your datasets. They have the most
current information and can walk you through the process and help you
avoid pitfalls that you might not be aware exist when selecting
licenses. You may also refer to the resources section for a list of
common, standard licences.  </p>
<h3 id="control">Control</h3>
<p>Related to, but distinct from data ownership, is the idea of data
control, which outlines the individual or body in which research groups
have designated to make decisions in regard to how data and research
materials are created, collected, and handled throughout the entire data
lifecycle. </p>
<p>While you may be the collector, owner, or licence holder on your
data, your control over that data may be limited or partially defined by
other factors, such as institutional policies, ethics requirements,
funder or publisher mandates, research agreements, etc. Control also
comes into play when we consider data collected from or on individuals,
in the context of Indigenous Peoples’ data, or other research activities
that involve partners. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note </p>
<p>Specifically in the context of Indigenous Peoples’ data, a number of
platforms and frameworks have been developed to help address issues and
concerns related to control and access to data, and research
collaborations continue to develop new approaches to ensure that such
data adhere to principles like the CARE principles. Two projects that
might be of particular interest to readers to explore this further
include Mukurtu, a platform for managing and sharing Indigenous cultural
heritage, and the Traditional Knowledge and Biocultural Labels and
Notices, developed through Local Contexts, to advance Indigenous data
sovereignty and Indigenous innovation. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>Data access is a two-way street. You may need to access someone
else’s data, and you need a way to know how, where, and under what
restrictions that access looks like. Someone may wish to access your
data, and you need to provide a way for others to know how, where, and
under what restrictions that access looks like. Access is often
independent of reuse, and helps support things like research
transparency and reproducibility, so we discuss data reuse separately
below. </p>
<p>You should note that access governance is often embedded in research
data platforms that are designed to help support long term storage, data
deposit for publication, and data sharing. Generally, your library can
help you navigate these platforms and the necessary information required
for deposit and defining access. Here, we will look the role of data
availability statements that accompany publications and the role of
specific positions at an institution or organization in controlling
access to research data. </p>
<p><strong><em>Data Access Statements</em></strong> </p>
<p>Data Access Statements, or Data Availability Statements are a section
of a scholarly publication that succinctly articulates if and/or how the
project’s data can be accessed. In the event that elements of a
publication’s data are restricted, they also provide an explanation for
this protection. </p>
<p>A data access statement should include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where data can be accessed, such as a specific
repository </p></li>
<li><p>A persistent access point or numbers, such as a DOI or URL, for
the employed data </p></li>
<li><p>Any restrictions on enclosed data </p></li>
<li><p>Reasons for data restrictions </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Accessing Others’ Data</em></strong> </p>
<p>It is crucial to ensure that any third-party data collected or
employed in your project is also secured with the correct permissions
for its reuse with respect for copyright. You should give serious
consideration to whether it will be important (or even integral) to be
able to share the third-party data. Confirmation of received permission
should be documented and preserved in this event. Practicing and
documenting respectful access practices towards others’ data will
enhance the legitimacy of your own efforts. </p>
<p>Data Access is often controlled by Data Stewards, who should be the
first point of contact in initiating a data access request. Universities
will often have specific forms to be completed, but some organizations
may rely on direct communication. </p>
<p>Any requests for others’ data (and requests for your own) should
include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identification information, such as the name of the
administrative entity (faculty) applying </p></li>
<li><p>The reason for your request and an explanation of how their data
would be used </p></li>
<li><p>An explanation of your own data security controls and request an
understanding of the provider’s requirements </p></li>
<li><p>Duration of proposed access </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the data, you may also be required to secure ethics
board support, personal permission from contributors, or perform a
privacy impact assessment. </p>
<h3 id="reuse">Reuse</h3>
<p>When using previously collected data, it is critical to understand
the genesis of those data: who has ownership over them, who has control
over their distribution, what aspects of copyright or other legal or
parallel frameworks pertain to them, how they are licenced, and what
level of control you will have over those data going forward. In
thinking about RDM and documentation, as a researcher, it is your
responsibility to equally echo all of these elements for your own
research data.</p>
