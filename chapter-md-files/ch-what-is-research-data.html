<h2 id="what-is-research-data">What is Research Data?</h2>
<p>The question of what constitutes research data can be unexpectedly
nuanced. It is not uncommon to see data, and as an extension of this,
research data, denoted as purely quantitative, defined only as
measurements and statistics. However, the nature of data are much
broader than this characterization would suggest. To understand data in
your field, it is valuable to consider your discipline’s data sources.
These may be people, films, photographs, recordings, artifacts,
specimens, music score sheets, art, or even an existing data set.
Conceptually, research data represent any material derived from a source
of potential information, both measurable and abstract, gathered for
analysis or as part of developing findings or insights on a subject.</p>
<p>Research data are traditionally stored in marked up documents,
databases, spreadsheets, and the like, as well as being embedded
directly into the applications or software used for analysis. These data
have important relationships to both their sources as well as to the
tools used to derive the data from these sources. For example, data on
people’s feelings about climate change are based on a source of the
sample of the population queried, and likely a survey questionnaire as
the data collection tool; the data are a byproduct of both the sample
and the construction of the survey. Other examples of data collection
tools include environmental sensors, software, such as web crawlers, or
forms for observational data collection. The interpretive frameworks
that surround the data collection process – choice and selection of data
source(s) and the materials or tools used to capture your data,
alongside the nature of their construction (this includes not only the
tools, but the models, hardware, software, descriptive protocols, etc.),
are a fundamental piece of the full narrative of research data.</p>
<p>Data will always involve a degree of subjective interpretation and
assumption in their creation, separating them from objective reality.
Collecting data involves conscious decisions to emphasize or disregard
certain factors that prevent a complete picture of a situation’s reality
from being developed. To take data as a given, or natural, unprocessed
resource, endangers ignoring the subjective elements behind its
creation, which can conceal overlooked factors or biases. Perhaps more
egregious still, considering data as purely objective can cause it to be
perceived as an absolute depiction of what is observed, and its
collection a mechanical process, instead of a product of interpretation.
Data should incorporate recognition of the interpretative framework and
decisions that led to the creation of these interpretations. Regarding
data as ‘capta’ or taken, instead of a given, recognizes that data is
constructed by its collectors, not a recording of pre-existing fact.
This is reinforced by the idiom that the scientific method, the
derivation of many of our data handling practices, is defined by
seeking, not finding, the truth.</p>
<p>Constructing and presenting data involves imposing further artificial
influences and assumptions that conceal many aspects of the underlying
interpretative framework. For example, a graph or pie chart can provide
simple and highly legible information. However, it does not necessarily
depict the limits of its chosen parameters, such as the elimination of
nuance in favour of binary categories. This is not an argument against
statistical or graphical representations of data. Instead, it is
intended as a reminder that data do not equal fact and that it is
important to remember subjective interpretation as part of data’s
conceptualization, creation, and representation.</p>
<p>All of this to say that defining research data is distinct from
defining an object as data. The former allows us to discuss in abstract
terms the difference between a data source – the source of one’s
analysis – and the data themselves – the objects of analysis. The latter
will have different applications of this abstract definition depending
on what, how, and why a particular research question is being asked. In
addition to this, research data cannot be disentangled from their
source, collection tools, interpretative processes, and presentation;
all guided by frameworks that impose a subjective element to the process
of creating data.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-rdm">What is RDM?</h2>
<p>Research Data Management (RDM) is the process of implementing
principles through practices, using documentation, conventions, and
where possible, standards, that ensure that managing your data provides
a level of organization, clarity, consistency, and resiliency to your
data. This makes it easy for you, your team, and others to work with and
understand it. RDM ensures that your data will be protected, accessible
well into the future, and in well understood terms, while also being
accessible and interpretable for others.</p>
