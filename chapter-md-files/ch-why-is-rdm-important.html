<p>Publications, including journal articles, presentations, books, etc.,
are generally the outputs measured to assign merit to research. However,
the process of conducting research is much richer than this model of
reward suggests. While these outputs inform everything from government
climate policy, private manufacturing practices, standards in trades and
other professions, foundations for moral and ethical principles that
govern societal norms and practices, evaluation of artistic merit of
urban planning, and health care decision matrices, to name a few, they
are constructed through processes and conventions that are founded on
the integrity of research data, such as reproducibility, methodological
integrity, preservation, archiving, community creation, institutional
and project memory, disciplinary best practices, communication of tacit
knowledge, etc. Ultimately, if these processes related to research data
lack integrity (e.g., poor study design, poor handling of the data at
the variable level or the data set, interpretation without disclosure of
bias, lack of archiving, miscommunication in community or other partners
in the research process, etc.), the data, and the outputs from those
data, should be looked upon with suspicion at best and avoided at
worst.</p>
<p>RDM is rooted in demonstrating this integrity, allowing one to
interpret, judge, and implement outputs adequately. RDM places data as
central to the research life cycle and something that should be made as
interpretable and open to scrutiny as a reference list in a publication.
How this integrity is interpreted and measured will differ between
disciplines, circumstances, and study designs. In general, this
integrity is enmeshed with concepts of academic integrity (honest
disclosure), bias (responsible conduct and well-designed projects),
stewardship (directing pathways of research), and sovereignty (control
and ownership over data).</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>A vital objective of RDM is preserving and demonstrating academic
integrity, ensuring that others can reproduce, validate, and employ your
work. Products of your work will enter the larger body of research that
has evolved over generations by building upon preceding research. Your
work, in turn, may be used to advance the works of others. Incorporating
and building upon others’ data and insights is a fundamental component
of research —no matter what form this research may take— and it is
founded upon academic integrity. The best way to prove your research’s
validity is to ensure that your data is produced and employed
consistently and accurately.</p>
<h3 id="data-integrity">Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Data integrity refers to preserving the quality, accuracy, and
comprehensiveness of your data in all facets of your project and
throughout the entire lifecycle of your data. Preserving data integrity
is a continuous process that can be undermined by relatively mundane or
difficult-to-detect issues, such as inaccurate or incomprehensive data
collection, file formatting issues, or simple mistakes like
transposition errors. Fostering data integrity through RDM practices
will ensure exceptional research results that reflect best practices and
intentions outlined in your research design.</p>
<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>Researchers are expected to produce evocative results, but ensuring
your claims and data can be easily validated is equally important. The
fundamental mechanism of this process is ensuring your work is
reproducible, meaning that a similar result can be produced under the
same conditions, with the same or similar data, materials, and methods.
What defines similar will be context and discipline specific; the
product of a sensory inquiry project will be conceptually different from
that of a DNA sampling method, as will the notion of similarity in
repeated attempts to collect data from their sources.</p>
<p>Although there is debate surrounding terms like reproducibility or
replicability, with different considerations and implications for each
of these, they represent valuable efforts to verify the legitimacy of
academic findings. Reproducibility ensures the legitimacy of your work
such that it can be used to augment future efforts. Transparent
representations of data and clearly explaining everything involved in
its production, including methodologies and variable definitions, is
integral to developing and preserving capacity for reproduction. Through
proper RDM, work is constructed in such a way that produces
well-substantiated results that reflect the integrity and ability of
those involved.</p>
<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>
<p>RDM ensures that data can be easily found, exchanged, and
interpreted; standards and conventions help to make this feasible, and
these should be integrated into RDM processes whenever possible. Use of
these has implications both for academic integrity and reproducibility,
but also for data re-use, as it is important to consider that your data
may have utility beyond the research project for which it was
collected.</p>
<p>A common framework used to articulate the domains in which these
standards should be deployed are the FAIR principles, standing for
findable, accessible, interpretable, and re-usable. You will find
descriptions of how the FAIR principles can be implemented in practice
throughout this text and you will be introduced to some of the
conventions and standards used to help enable successful implementation.
In the context of this text, findable and re-usable connect with the
section Data Sharing, while accessible and interoperable connect with
the section Data About Data.</p>
<h3 id="ownership-and-sovereignty">Ownership and Sovereignty</h3>
<p>While you may collect and use data in the context of research, these
data may not be yours and control and ownership may reside elsewhere;
RDM helps to ensure that issues of ownership and sovereignty are
properly addressed. These concepts are explored in this text in the
context of legal frameworks and research agreements – see the sections
on licencing and research partnerships, respectively – and in frameworks
that speak to the respectful and responsible conduct of research. Of
note in this respect are the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data
Governance, which articulate principles related to collective
governance, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics of data.
This guiding framework can be implemented into RDM practices in many
ways and are often complimented by local guidance, resources, and
infrastructure to help support their implementation.</p>
