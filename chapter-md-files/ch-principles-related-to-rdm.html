<h2 id="principles-related-to-rdm">Principles Related to RDM</h2>
<p>Two principles inform much of the content of this text. The first are
the FAIR Principles, which address technical considerations for
effective RDM. The second are the CARE Principles, which address the
need to consider that technology alone is insufficient for effective
RDM.</p>
<h3 id="fair">FAIR</h3>
<p>The FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable), play a key role in the reuse of data after a project’s
completion, but in order for these principles to be achieved, thought
should be given to these concepts throughout the research data life
cycle. The Go-Fair organization provides resources to help FAIR
Principles be realized, and more information can be found here.</p>
<p>The FAIR Principles were developed by a group of academics,
acknowledging that so much research funding is dedicated to the
collection/production/assembling of data, but that oftentimes this data
becomes ‘lost’ after a project’s completion. This results in many
projects having to reduplicate the same or similar processes to answer
research questions, which results in a lot of wasted time and money. The
goal of these principles is to make research data available to others
after a project has been completed, allowing for a more global approach
to answering research questions, and accelerating the pace at which
progress in these areas can be made.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate FAIR, making data findable refers to
depositing data and associated materials into a searchable resource,
accompanied with rich metadata to facilitate others discoverability of
the data, as well as a unique, persistent identifier to ensure the data
has a known, retrievable location. Once data is discovered by a user,
they will likely want to know how to access it. Access is generally
covered in documentation and protocols that indicate how data can be
opened (appropriate software or hardware required), if they are
restricted, how to get authorized access, etc. To facilitate data
access, interoperability refers to a variety of hardware and software
being able to read and interpret the data and metadata. This boils down
to the using standards, controlled languages, and structures that are
shared and defined in a precise way. A large part of data’s reusability
comes with accompanying documentation to describe the context under
which the data was collected or generated, whether the data is in its
original format or if it has been processed, and what processes it has
undergone, as well as definitions and explanations of variable names and
measurements.</p>
<h3 id="care">CARE</h3>
<p>Complimenting the FAIR Principles are the CARE Principles for
Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics). The Global Indigenous Data Alliance
articulates these principles in more detail on their website, which can
be found here.</p>
<p>The CARE Principles were developed in part in reaction to the FAIR
principles, recognizing that that in trying to make data open and
accessible for everybody, these principles lack consideration of the
historical contexts and power differentials associated with data. This
falls in line with the idea that data is socially constructed, and
stresses the importance of being conscious of cultural and community
relationships to data, and ensuring these relationships are respected
and the people involved are respected. While these principles were
developed specifically with the governance of Indigenous data in mind,
there is merit in applying these principles in all research data related
contexts.</p>
<p>The notion of Collective Benefit refers to ensuring that data are
designed and function in ways that are beneficial not only to
researchers, but to the Indigenous communities (or other groups) whom
the data are related to. This involves processes that place these
communities at the center of decision making in regards to what happens
with their data, giving a specific focus to community values and any
value that is realized in the data outputs. This flows into providing
these communities with the Authority to Control their data, and that the
people, their lands, resources, identities, and values are represented
in the data. To help realize these first two principles, there is the
Responsibility of those working with communities to focus on developing
positive and respectful relationships, and to build capacity for data
literacy to support meaningful engagement and contributions from the
communities. And underlying all these principles is the Ethics of those
working with these communities to ensure that community rights and
wellbeing are placed at the forefront throughout the data life cycle,
ensuring that harm is minimized and benefit is maximized.</p>
