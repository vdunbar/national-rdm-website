<li><p>Two of the key principles of RDM are the FAIR Principles and the
CARE Principles</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>FAIR Principles</strong> (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) offer an ideal model for the reuse after a
projectâ€™s completion, and need to be considered throughout the data life
cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>CARE Principles for Indigenous Data
Governance</strong> (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics) recognize that the goals of the FAIR
Principles can lack consideration of the historical contexts and power
differentials associated with data, and stress the importance of
cultural consciousness and respect.</p></li>
