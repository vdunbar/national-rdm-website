<ul>
<li><p>File names should be both human interpretable and machine
readable.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a file naming convention that is used by all your
project collaborators will help ensure that your files are named
consistently and remain organized.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no “right” convention, and the best solution is one that
you and your group can all follow consistently.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever naming convention you create, make sure there is
documentation to explain how it works so that others can interpret it,
and update the documentation as necessary.</p></li>
