<li><p>Creating documentation that accompanies and describes your data
and files is vital to ensuring it’s interpretability and
(re)use.</p></li>
<li><p>There are different types of files to help document your work,
and while your specific projects may not need all of them, you should
consider what is necessary for your work to be interpreted by others,
and where these files should reside.</p></li>
<li><p>Using metadata standards that provide a controlled way of
identifying and describing aspects of your project can be quite valuable
for certain types of projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing information regarding the licencing of your data and
how it can be used or re-used by others, and doing so at the onset of a
project, is a good way to keep your data’s use within the desired
parameter.</p></li>
