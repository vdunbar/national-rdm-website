<li><p>The research data life cycle is a model to describe all of the
processes and transformations that your data will undergo and be
subjected to, beginning from the planning stage of your project, and
carrying through its collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization,
dissemination, and deposit, and/or archiving.</p></li>
<li><p>Research data should be considered in terms of its original
source, including any biases which shaped its generation, as well as the
various versions that it may subsquently take.</p></li>
<li><p>By keeping track of the evolution of data through version
controls, you are creating an audit trail to discern what changed, how
it changed, and who changed it, which has many benefits related to
RDM.</p></li>
<li><p>Version control can be accomplished both manually and
automatically, both of which have strengths and specific use
cases.</p></li>
